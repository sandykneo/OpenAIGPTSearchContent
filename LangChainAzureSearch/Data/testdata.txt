Specific Benefit Plan Details
Okay, tell me a little more. What aspect of your benefits do you want to understand?
Health
What Health options are you looking for?
Medical
What Medical information do you want to select?
Medical Plan Overview
The Company offers two separate plans for medical coverage. The Health Savings Account Plan (HSA) or the Health Reimbursement Account Plan (HRA). Both plans are administered by Contoso Healthcare. 

Compare the plans on the benefits website.
Difference between HAS and HRA
The HSA Plan is designed to encourage you to know your options and the cost implications of your choices. You have a higher deductible, but the optional tax-free Health Savings Account (HSA) and your lower monthly contributions can help you cover out-of-pocket costs. You also can carry forward unused dollars if you don't use all the money in your HSA in a particular year. 

The HRA Plan includes a Health Reimbursement Account or HRA, to help you pay for eligible medical and prescription drug expenses. With the HRA Plan, you have a lower deductible and higher monthly contributions compared to the HSA Plan. 

You can view a great chart of the differences between the 2 plans by following these steps: 
1.	Please log into the benefits website. 
2.	Click on the "My Benefits" tab.
3.	Select the option "Estimate My 2019 FSA and HSA Contributions".
4.	Scroll down to the box that says, "Medical Plan Comparison" and click on "Get Started".
Tobacco-Free Incentive
If you and your spouse/domestic partner are tobacco-free, you will pay less than a tobacco-user for medical coverage – $50 per month for you and $50 per month for your spouse/domestic partner.  In addition, if your dependent children age 18 (as of January 1, 2020) and older are tobacco-free, you will pay $50 less per month, up to a maximum of $250 per family per month.

If you would like to learn more, the benefits website has more details.
Prescription Drugs
When you enroll in the medical plan, you will have prescription drug coverage through Contoso Care. The prescription drug coverage works the same under the HSA and the HRA Plans. There is no out-of-network prescription drug benefit in either medical plan. That means, if you get your prescription filled at out-of-network pharmacies, you will not be reimbursed by the medical plan. You'll be responsible for 100% of the cost, and it will not count toward your deductible or out-of-pocket maximum.  You might also find it helpful to look at the prescription drug types and cost by retail or mail order. 

You can find that in the prescription drug section of the benefits website.
Dental Coverage
The company offers dental coverage, providing up to $1,000 per person in annual dental benefits. The plan encourages regular exams and cleanings by covering preventive care at 100% in and out-of-network. The dental plan includes a network of dentists and dental care providers. You have the flexibility to use non-network providers; when you do, you pay a larger share of the cost and are responsible for any charges above the reasonable and customary (R&C) cost (Average cost of specific services in your geographical area).  

You can learn more about the program in the Dental section in the benefits website.
Vision Coverage
The company offers coverage for you and your family through Contoso Vision. If you enroll, the plan helps you pay for eye exams, lenses and frames. When you use Contoso Vision eye care professionals, you pay an annual deductible, then the plan covers exams and lenses – and gives you an allowance toward the cost of frames or contacts. You also have the flexibility to use providers outside Contoso Vision; when you do, however, you pay more of the cost.

You can learn more about the program in the Vision section in the benefits website.
Optional Spending Accounts
What Optional Spending Account are you interested in?
Flexible Spending Account (FSA)
Flexible Spending Accounts provide tax savings that help your money go a lot further for medical, prescription drug, dental and vision expenses. Consider this tax-free account to save between 15% and 28% on eligible healthcare expenses.  You can set aside pre-tax dollars for eligible expenses – saving you income tax and Social Security (FICA) taxes.  

The standard Flexible Spending Account provides tax savings that help your money go a lot further for medical, prescription drug, dental and vision expenses. You can participate in the FSA for health care if you enroll in the HRA Plan or you don’t have company medical coverage.

If you would like to learn more, the benefits website has more details.
Limited Purpose Flexible Spending Account (LPFSA)
Flexible Spending Accounts provide tax savings that help your money go a lot further for medical, prescription drug, dental and vision expenses. Consider this tax-free account to save between 15% and 28% on eligible healthcare expenses.  You can set aside pre-tax dollars for eligible expenses, saving you income tax and Social Security (FICA) taxes.  

The Limited Purpose FSA can be used to pay for dental and vision expenses only, such as exams, coinsurance, deductibles, orthodontia, contact lenses, reading glasses and LASIK.  You can participate in the Limited Purpose FSA if you enroll in the HSA Plan.

If you would like to learn more, the benefits website has more details.
Health Savings Account (HSA)
If you enroll in the HSA, you receive an Health Savings Account Card to pay for eligible expenses. Once you receive your Health Saving Account Debit Card, it’s important that you activate and sign the back of the card. You can use the debit card as credit, with no Personal Identification Number (PIN) required at eligible health care providers such as doctors’ offices in addition to retail locations like pharmacies or grocery stores. You also can use it for dental care, vision care and more! 

If you would like further details, please visit the benefits website.
Dependent Care Reimbursement Account (DCRA)
You can set aside from $120 to $5,000 tax-free each year ($2,500 if married and file a separate tax return) in the Dependent Care Reimbursement Account to use for day care expenses for your eligible dependents. Eligible dependents include children under age 13 or your disabled spouse or domestic partner, child or dependent parent living with you. You can use the account for:
•	Day care centers
•	In-home care
•	Certain day-camps
•	Elder day care
